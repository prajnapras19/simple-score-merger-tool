Additional notes:
-NIS stands for "Nomor Induk Sekolah" in Bahasa Indonesia, or "Student Identification Number" in English
-Nama is "name" in English
-The format of NIS and Nama in sorted.csv must be followed
-The format of NIS in evry other files must be followed
-Because this tool is treating NIS and course names as key in dictionary (see https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#dictionaries), here are some restrictions:
  a. Every NIS must be different each other (unique)
  b. Every course names must be different for each semester (if it is a different semester)
